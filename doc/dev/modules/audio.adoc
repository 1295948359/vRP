This module handles audio features.

self.voice_channels = {} -- map of channel => map of player => state (0-1)

-- play audio source (once)
--- url: valid audio HTML url (ex: .ogg/.wav/direct ogg-stream url)
--- volume: 0-1 
--- x,y,z: position (omit for unspatialized)
--- max_dist  (omit for unspatialized)
--- player: (optional) player source id, if passed the spatialized source will be relative to the player (parented)

-- remove named audio source

-- request connection to another player for a specific channel
Audio:connectVoice(channel, player)

-- disconnect from another player for a specific channel
-- player: nil to disconnect from all players
Audio:disconnectVoice(channel, player)

-- register callbacks for a specific channel
--- on_request(player): should return true to accept the connection
--- on_connect(player, is_origin): is_origin is true if it's the local peer (not an answer)
--- on_disconnect(player)

-- check if there is an active connection
-- return boolean or nil

-- check if there is a pending connection
-- return boolean or nil
Audio:isVoiceConnecting(channel, player)

-- enable/disable speaking
--- player: nil to affect all channel peers
--- active: true/false

----- spatialization => { max_dist: ..., rolloff: ..., dist_model: ... } (per peer effect)
